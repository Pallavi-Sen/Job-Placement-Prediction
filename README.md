# Job-Placement-Prediction
This project applies Machine Learning to predict whether a student is likely to get placed based on their educational performance, skills, and background data. The model helps educational institutions and students gain insights into factors influencing employability and placement success rates.

Objectives

Analyze student datasets to identify patterns affecting placement chances.

Preprocess data for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.

Train and evaluate multiple ML models to predict job placement outcomes.

Compare model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, and F1-Score.

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and formatted numerical data.

Applied Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding for categorical columns.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for model efficiency.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Building

Implemented and compared multiple algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

Best Model: Random Forest (Highest Accuracy)

Results & Insights

Achieved good accuracy on the test set.

Identified that work experience and MBA percentage significantly impact placement chances.

Visualized feature importance and correlation to understand dataset behavior.

Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Scikit-learn for model building

Jupyter Notebook for development
